0,"Javier was great but was clear that his hands where tied due to issue is from product purchased over 90 says ago. Regardless, I called because a fan blade literally broke in 2 pieces and flew hitting the wall next to a recliner in the living room. An injury could have happened. He referred me to the Home Decorations and they do not show any interest in correcting or making right what could have been a very serious injury due a product defect. Home Depot consequently is apathetic and continuous selling the product, no recalls, no removal from the shelves. An installed fan blade made out of hard plastic broke in two and flew across the room. I wonder what our government Consumer Protection would say about it.","('PROD',)"
1,"my problem has to do with my veterans discount and how hard it is to get any help from your 800 customer service.  Each time I called I spoke with a person who was not in the usa, and though they do speak english (better then I could speak their language) I could not understand and they could not help.  Please hire in the usa.  As to my veterans discount maybe it has been solved.  Why is everything now either smartphone or pc?  What happened to just showing my VA card? And what will you do when the entire IT world crumbles?","('LANG',)"
2,"If you ship me a broken product I should not have to wait until it_x0019_s picked up, and then wait for a refund, and then call back and wait for someone to fix it to the original price to order. I have already spent hours on the phone with customer service and don_x0019_t want to do it again. Also the packaging was horrible and it_x0019_s no wonder it arrived damaged.","('GNRL', 'TIME', 'WAIT')"
3,"It was disappointing to receive the item in such bad shape.  It appears it was a returned item that was put back on the shelf and then sent out again.  Beside the issues reported I realize after I called, that the legs were attached, the Use and Care Guide was missing and the mat for the top drawer was also missing.  That all indicates the item was a return.  I would appreciate if we could also receive those 2 additional items.","('GNRL', 'STORE')"

I was offered a replacement part for the rubber sealing that_x0019_s malfunctioning. I requested a repairman to come to my home and replace the rubber sealing and was told I had to do it myself.

She said I didn_x0019_t change nothing that_x0019_s the store it always was.

34,While I don_x0019_t blame Kelsey at all because she did her job with what info she could do with. The BLAME is totally on the parts department and communicating with her regarding the part.  She followed thru with an email telling me she still didn_x0019_t have an answer from parts. I declined her offer in the email and found part with another vendor.   Whether it b a day or a few days this was unacceptable. Not good business practice to leave the customer hanging.  ,"('COMM/SOFT',)"
35,Kelsey was very kind and professional in her handling of my call but her hands were tied with getting proper information ,"('CREDIT',)"
39,I am dissatisfied with my experience being rung out during this visit to Home Depot. The cashier miscounted the number of boards I purchased. I didn_x0019_t catch it until it had been rung out. She told me I had to go to customer service to get it corrected. That her register could not perform refunds. This corporate policy and its fallout presents a lack of customer focused policies and is not appealing to me as your customer. Though Home Depot is closer to me I will consider traveling further to another provider due to policies like this.,"('GNRL', 'STORE')"

When contacted and supplied pictures, was told fire pit finish wasn_x0019_t covered and I was welcome to buy another one.  Luckily your Olathe in store manager (after 3 weeks of this nonsense of communication or lack of) stepped up and did the right thing after I physically took fire pit in to be seen.  It was obvious warranty item right off and he exchanged it immediately.  Disappointed in online and call center service.  Happy with in store clerks and management.

54,"Terrible customer care after the sale of around $30,000. Delivery Drivers I would terminate; they do what and when they want. Terrible, Terrible,. I probably would not allow them back on my property (2 of them). Deliveries with no manifestos; brought wrong products at wrong time. Prepared and strapped product wrong; ie subfloor under roof sheeting. Contacted store manager via text on July 4th and was told in reply text that he was on his 1st vacation of the year and he contacted his team at store and then said sorry. As usual nothing was done. It was my problem. I rented a trailer from U-haul and drove 11 miles to store and loaded my materials for framers waiting. I made 4 trip on three days. I have many more disgusting experiences with home depot on the two weeks since my house started up. It is now under roof in 12 days no thanks to the team at home depot. I must say Tiffany was a great asset when we were at store to get materials. What a difference she made under  disgusting circumstances. She was great getting staff to pick and load.

55,"First off, it took a lot of frustration for me to get to this point. I have been a Home Depot customer for 40 plus years and have spent many thousands of dollars in those 40 years. I have had minor problems that have been resolved in the past. Your customer service has been great until I call about my passed experience. Orlando really did not address my issue. My problem was more than one time I have been to you Upper Marlboro location to purchase products you show in stock. Only to get disappointed that they could not find the product.","('GNRL',)"

To walk around the store for over a half hour looking for something that was to be in Aisle 9, bay 003. Does not set well with me. I was told by Orlando that incorrect inventory is to be adjusted by the manager. This was not the first time this has happened like I said.

61,Read the God damn report made,"('GNRL',)"
62,"Home Depot_x0018_s policy of allowing anyone to say that they are a veteran and give a phone number without providing proper identification is equivalent to identity theft. Our service means nothing is an individual who is never served a day in their life can use our phone numbers without being required to produce an ID the rumblings of a few veterans who should have their military identification on them should not trump those who are responsible and carry their ID with them. Home Depot is allowing criminals to steal the identities of veterans without consequence, while it would be a crime for that same person or a veteran to come into Home Depot and take your products and walk out the store. I find that to be hypocrisy. Home Depot protects their products, but will not protect the veterans they are supposed to be honoring by way of giving a discount for our service. I had to fully remove my phone number and forfeit my discount in order to protect my identity from being stolen. How is that honoring me or any other veteran who are knowingly is having their discount and identity stolen by dishonest, disrespectful individuals? Lowes does not do that.","('CREDIT', 'STORE')"

69,A follow up call to verify that problem was resolved. I currently have no zero turn mower due to a manufacturer warranty issue and no confirmation that the problem is being resolved.,"('PNK', 'WARR')"
75,"My issue was not with any of the people I spoke with or with Home Depot at all. However Home Depot customer service was who helped resolve my issue. Ultimately I returned the item and decided to look for something else that was not from Hampton bay. I don_x0019_t feel the options I was offered initially were at all acceptable for a shipment weighing over 250lbs when the product I received was damaged. Especially when one of the options was to pay for an additional set out of pocket so it could be shipped for me to dig out the piece I needed and and then send back what I didn_x0019_t use in order to get refunded for one of the sets. Again this shipment weighed 250+lbs! That option is simply ridiculous, not mention who has en extra $1000 to purchase a second set of one piece of the main structure of a product that was received damaged. That is not a manufacturer I will purchase from again in the future. When I received the follow up call from Dulce and another gentleman followed by email I was never contacted again even after replying to emails and leaving a VM message. When I called Home Depot customer service number not on the Hampton bay packet the two people I spoke with did everything they could to provide other options and I appreciate their understanding, kindness and patience with me being so frustrated as this process took several days to finally get resolved.","('GNRL', 'SHPDLV')"

I was told different stories by multiple agents of why our order couldn_x0019_t be canceled, then was shuttled around to different agents because _x001C_this isn_x0019_t my department_x001D_ etc. Funny enough, the person that finally canceled my order did so in less than 5 minutes. It was not a difficult task to accomplish. On top of that, it took the HD 4 weeks to fail to deliver a $4000 mower. We went to the local Kubota dealer, they delivered our new mower the SAME DAY with WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY better customer service. Not once did the HD offer a gift card or any sort of compensation for their complete and utter lack of organization or ability to complete the order. So not only did we not buy the mower, we will NEVER shop at the HD for anything ever again. I don_x0019_t care if it_x0019_s a screwdriver. I will drive out of my way and spend more money just to support a local business and not ever support the HD.

I dealt with a male employee, very helpful, & a female employee, who repeatedly informed me of what I already knew, that the vendor was sending the wrong items, and that they would probably continue to do that.
